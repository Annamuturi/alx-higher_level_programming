I have practice:

* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file 
* What is args and how to use it
* What is `kwargs` and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

The following function tools were used in creating all the classes and testing its functionality:
* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attribute
* Getter/Setter
* Class method
* Static method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Read/Write file
* args/kwargs
* JSON and CSV
* serialization/deserialization

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
